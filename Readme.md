# Ludum Dare 57

Theme: Depths

## Brainstorming

Depths means deep things
It means below the surface
It means not obvious or visible

So some takes:
* Going deep into something
	* A canyon
	* A mine
	* The ocean
	* Space
	* Spaceships :)
* Exploring dimensions of something
	* The map
	* A mechanic
	* An input mechanism
	* Single input with multiple applications (the depths of the mechanic)
	* The story

You could explore a mine as a dwarf
Going down into the depths
Mining deeper

Instead of building a city up
You could build a city down
Into a hole
Dig the hole and expand your city

Strategy game?

Unlock levels of the game as you go
Going further and further down

Levels of hell?
Dante?

Submarines seem obvious
Pilot a submarine
Avoid others
Avoid octopi
Avoid jellyfish

Souls like?

Platformer - always

Puzzle

Strategy

Volcano

### Idea 1

Pipelaying game
You must go as deep as possible
You have an inventory of pipes
There's a required depth for each level
Essentially a puzzle game
Different types of pipes can't be connected
Some pipes go up
Different terrains may block you or not allow certain pipes through
Could have multiple pipes


### Idea 2

First person platforming game
Grapple mechanic to go from platform to platform
You must lower the laser grid by activating levers
Or picking up power packs
Or pressing buttons
Or collecting cubes to press buttons
In any case, you must lower the laser grid
To get to your goal
As you lower the grid, you can start to travel to lower platforms
Until you reach the goal for each level

Themes:
Mine and maybe gas preventing further exploration
	* Modern
		* Gas
		* Putting up shorings to prevent mine collapse
	* Fantasy - dragons below?
		* Adding things to drive the dragons away?
		* Dungeon that must be unlocked so you can progress
Futuristic tech and laser grid


### Concept

Explore the depths of the tower

A futuristic tower

You are a robot

You have three major functions
	* Moving around
	* Grappling to targets
	* Pressing buttons

Your goal is to move downward

There is a laser grid that prevents you from moving downward

You must push the grid downward to progress

Buttons around the level will push the grid downward

Sometimes multiple buttons must be pressed to move it downward

Some buttons go down
Some buttons go up

Some buttons are linked together. All must be pressed to progress

A secondary grid may come in an limit how far up you may go
This grid progresses with the other

Some buttons spread these grids apart

Some buttons do multiple things at once
* Move grid apart but also up
* Move grid down but together
